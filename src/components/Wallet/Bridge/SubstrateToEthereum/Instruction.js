      Transferring assets through the bridge is a multi step process. This app will track it for you. Here's a summary of what will happen:
      <ol>
        <li>
          Your LLD or LLM will be transferred to bridge and you'll receive a
          Receipt. This only costs a small amount of Liberland Transaction fee.
        </li>
        <li>After transaction is confirmed, Bridge network will transfer funds over to Ethereum. It takes ~1 minute.</li>
        <li>After transfer, there's a security freeze of 1h. Your funds are safely kept in Bridge during this period.</li>
        <li>
          After the freeze you can claim the coins on Ethereum. This costs {lldFee} ETH for {bridges.LLD.token.symbol}
          {' '}
          transfer and {llmFee} ETH for {bridges.LLM.token.symbol} transfer (plus standard transaction fees).
        </li>
      </ol>
